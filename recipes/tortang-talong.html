    <h2> Description*</h2>
   

    <p> Traditionally, the eggplants are grilled until the skin is charred and the flesh inside is tender. However, if pressed for time, you can forgo the grilling and just boil the eggplant. But by doing so, you will no longer have that added smoky flavor, but it should still come out great.
        You then is then peel the skin off the grilled eggplants and mash the flesh. Next, dip it in a mixture of egg, saut√©ed ground pork, and seasoning. Lastly, it will be fried until golden brown and slightly crispy.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Asian eggplants</li>
            <li>3-5 tablespoons of oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion - chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic-minced</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>fennel pasta
            <li>salt & pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. Poke small holes in the eggplant and boil for 5 minutes or until cooked. Remove from water and let it cool down a bit before peeling the skins.</li>
            <li>Cut it into two, lengthwise (stem included). (No need to cut if using small eggplants).Flatten the eggplants using a fork making sure that it is still intact and attached to the stem.</li>
            <li>Saute garlic and onion in a tablespoon of oil until limp. Add the ground pork and season with salt and pepper. Let it cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes or until all pieces are cooked. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a bowl then add the ground pork and flour to the beaten eggs.</li>
            <li>On a skillet or pan preferably non-stick), heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-low heat. Scoop 2-3 tablespoon of the mixture into the pan, spreading it into a circle enough to cover a piece of the eggplant. Lay the eggplant on top and arrange it that it spreads flat over the egg mixture. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes or until the bottom side is lightly browned. Carefully transfer it to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add some more oil to the pan if needed, then scoop another 2-3 tablespoon of the mixture and spread like before. Now lay the same eggplant on top of the mixture with the top-side facing down to sandwich the eggplant with the egg mixture. Cook until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Repeat this with the rest of the eggplants.</li>
